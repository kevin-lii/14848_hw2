### Part 1:
The URL for the Docker image that is uploaded to my DockerHub account is in the file `dockerHubImageLink.txt`. If you are too lazy to open that file the link is `https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/kevinlii/helloworld`.

The screenshot for the execution of the docker container on GCP is called `gcr_helloworld_screenshot.png`.

The Dockerfile and source code are located in this GitHub repository and are named `Dockerfile` and `hello.py` respectively.

### Part 2:
The screenshot for running Jupyter notebook that is provided from this docker image is called  `mmlspark_screenshot.png`.

### Extra Credit:
The screenshots of my first docker container deployed to Kubernetes Engine on GCP is called `kubernetes_deploy_log.png` and `kubernetes_deploy_detail.png`.
